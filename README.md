As this is a firefox extension there are no dependencies but firefox itself.

This flake provides an overlay for firefox that includes this extension, as shown in the [firefox.section.md](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/builders/packages/firefox.section.md) of nixpkgs, showing a snapshot in time when firefox was built with this extension enabled.
